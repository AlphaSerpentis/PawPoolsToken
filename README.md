# v0.0.2 - Paw Pools Token ($PAW) / Paw Pools Mining Fee Reduction Token ($PAWMFR)

An ERC20-based token ran on the Ethereum network.

Paw Pools Token or "PAW" (name still being considered) is an ERC20-based token that relies on PoW on the Paw Pools mining pool.
The tokens are minted based on mining activity and by random (integration sill being considered). The ability to mine a block can also determine minting.
The tokens can be redeemed to lower the mining fee down to a minimum of 0.10% (AMOUNT MIGHT CHANGE DEPENDING ON INTEGRATION)
The tokens are used up by "activating" them which each token will enable a miner to receive a 0.02% discount for one hour.
After one hour, they are disposed of, in other words, burnt.

**CURRENTLY TESTING ON THE ROPSTEN NETWORK - NO TANGIBLE VALUE!**
